									<p>Xinmeng is a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Tufts University. Her research interest is in bioinformatics and machine learning. She is recently working on antibody sequence analysis, extracting key features from antibody protein sequences and applying statistical test and machine learning algorithms to analyze the features. She also works on metabolite annotation, collecting mass spectrum data from databases and analyzing the data with neural networks to understand the presence or absence of metabolites in the biology context.</p>
